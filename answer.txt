2) I would like to show the disk information like disk status and usage in healthcheck endpoint.  



5) How would you automate the build/test/deploy process for this application? (a verbal answer is enough. installation of CICD is bonus, not required)

     I will use jenkins pipeline to create mutiple stages for each.

What branching strategy would you use for development?

 Story/Feature View

Master" is the main branch for CI/CD process
Each developer will create their own story/feature level branch from "Master"
Developer should take regular pull from "Master" to be updated with latest code
Perform following steps on feature branch and developer can delete/merge the branch only when all Steps of doneness are done. These steps include
  Code development
  fixing  static violations
  Unit testing
  Review
Code review and then Incorporating all review comments
Once the code review comments are incorporated and the pre-commit analysis is successful, Reviewer can merge the code to "Master" branch


What CICD tool/service would you use?

         Jenkins

What stages would you have in the CICD pipeline?

         1)  Compile      mvn clean compile
         2)  Unit tests   mvn test
         3)  build        mvn clean install

What would be the purpose of each stage in CICD pipeline

The purpose for each stage in CICD pipeline is to bifurcate the entire code into smaller section/stages and give better readablity of code and easiness in debugging if any particular stage gets failed then build does not run for the entire code which will save the time, like in above example we have 3 stages in 1 stage we only compile the code and 2 stage we only run the unit test.
